## :fire: *App and Network deployment to allow messaging in crisis* :fire:

Project about the deployment of a group of drones in which they connect to form a wifi Network that helps people connect with their Android devices and lets them send messages to ask for help or let emergency services about their situation.
The project is based in the MQTT (Mosquitto protocol) which allows an intermitent connection, which is helful during crisis where commercial or usual networks tend to be offline.

## :globe_with_meridians: *Motivation* :globe_with_meridians:

 
Disasters and catastrophes wreak havoc on people, communities, and entire cultures around the world every year. 
They are expected to increase in frequency in the future, which is alarming. Natural disasters like tornadoes, 
hurricanes, earthquakes, floods, wildfires, mudslides, or droughts can happen, or they can be created by people 
(e.g., mass shootings, chemical spills, or terrorist attacks). The behavioral health of individuals and communities
depends on their ability to prevent disasters and traumatic events, to respond to them, and to recover from them.

People may react in a variety of ways when faced with a disaster, many of which are normal reactions to difficult 
circumstances. After a calamity, most people demonstrate resilience. Resilience is the capacity to overcome obstacles
and persevere under difficult circumstances. Fortunately, resilience in catastrophe recovery is commonplace rather 
than exceptional, and people frequently show this ability. supportive tools. But with the technology as a resource that allows for damage assessment, real-time information gathering and rapid response, as well as mapping affected areas and analyzing them to see what kind of assistance victims need we could better manage catastrophes.


An example that the Mexican students can identify with is the earthquake in September 19 of 2017, in which the signal 
was down and nobody was able communicate or send messages if they were in an emergency or safe. Even our school 
collapse, nowadays we have a new campus after 5 years but the fear and the psychological damage that this caused and 
other recent earthquakes can make many people can collapse and shock. This made all the students at that time that earthquakes are not a game, because some of them had to take out people from the collapsed buildings. In the old tes de buildings were connected by a bridge and also all the bridges collapsed and buildings were very damaged.

Other example that touches everyone was the case of a school called Enrique Rebsamen, this was a school of kids that also collapse in the earthquake already said , this school was full of kids and with irregularities in their structure and official documents. Many kids die and not all the kids could be taken out, nowadays this building continues collapse and the owner of the school is fugitive.

Another example in which Brazilians students can identify are the floodings that are very dangerous but normally regular. It’s normal the feeling that in one second all your things and life can disappear or change. In Brazil, the flooding leaves damage and takes a lot of lives and communication can change a lot of things because the people can advise the next towns the situation that is going to happen in seconds.

Introdrucing Specifically about floods, many people around the world live in zones that are more prone to floodings than
others, we have taken the challenge to help all those people around the world that in case of emergency they may need to
communicate, and we are aiming to create a system based on a network mounted in drones, to help people connect to send 
messages through that network in order to let people contact emergency services an to let them know where they are and
what they need.

After we see and live this kind of catastrophes, we are in a position of changing and create something that can help to 
avoid some hard situations.It's a very interesting and important challenge to achieve.

# 📋 *Deliverables* 📋

- Step 1 Project Setup

Firts we had to identify the technical and non-technicals requirements of the projects with the required documents and set a GitHub


- Step 2 Client and Edge Stage

In this deliverable we configured the emulation scenario and we implemented the android client with the requiered brokers

Here is the link for the Step 2: https://youtu.be/xLfU2teIvqk

- Step 3 Cloud Stage

For this step we had to implement the broker in the cloud which received the messages from the broker and with an integration with the SQL database
